// Minimal JS for interactions not handled by SSR standard links
// Mostly empty now as SSR handles rendering and navigation.

// Profile check logic might still be useful if we want to update the header dynamically 
// without reloading everything, but SSR template already has user info.
// So we can probably remove most of this.

// We keep this file for potential future client-side enhancements.
